# About Metaverse
Metaverse is a public blockchain based on the PoW consensus mechanism. Metaverse is committed to providing decentralized services based on asset registration, digital asset exchange, digital identity and value intermediaries in order to build an open ecosystem in which digital value can be circulated freely. ETP is the token used on Metaverse and can be used to measure the value of smart properties in Metaverse or as collateral in financial transactions. ETP is also used to pay transaction and other fees applied on Metaverse.
